    <pre>
        The word Core describes the basic concept of something, 
        and here, the phrase 'Core Java' defines the basic Java that covers 
        the basic concept of Java programming language. 
        We all are aware that Java is one of the well-known 
        and widely used programming languages, and to begin with it, 
        the beginner has to start the journey with Core Java and then towards the Advance Java. 
        The Java programming language is a general-purpose programming language 
        that is based on the OOPs concept. The ocean of Java is too deep to learn, 
        as much you learn more, you will know its depth. 
        Java is a platform-independent and robust programming language. 
        The principle followed by Java is WORA that says Write Once, Run Anywhere. 
        The programming language is quite simple and easy to understand. 
        But one should know that Core Java is not different from Java. 
        Java is complete in itself, but for the beginners, it is natural that 
        the beginner must begin with the core concepts of Java. In actual, Java has different editions, 
        where Core Java is one of the parts of an edition.
